Me Learning Go
==============

Using Kubernetes, of course.

The Plan
--------

Using Bash, Go and tests to drive the whole way via docker and k8s:

1. Put data in MongoDB (since I've never used it)
2. Foodstuffs API allows CRUD on food items, stored as documents
3. Static web site generation for static content
4. Single-page Javascript app for UI
5. Perhaps use bleeding-edge headless CMS for shits-and-giggles

Perhaps some python where appropriate as well.
